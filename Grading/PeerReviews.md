Remember to give thoughtful, constructive feedback. That means:
* Include something you liked in addition to things that you think could have been improved.
* Be specific. Specific things that you think could be improved in an assignment are more helpful than general comments.
* Be constructive! Remember that we're all working together, and the goal is to help each other develop new skills. 

Peer reviews are due by 5pm on Friday.
